## Ammonia for shipping fuels 

* Using ammonia as a shipping fuel could disturb the nitrogen cycle[@wolfram2022]

![](GGS621/ammonia.png)

### Summarize the key findings

-   Ammonia(NH~3~) has been proposed as a shipping fuel. But potential adverse side-effects is not deeply discussed. Also,excessive [reactive notrigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen)(N~r~, 반응성 질소) in water and air leads to environmental damages such as eutrophication(부영양화) and air pollution.
-   N~r~ usually emis N~2~O as a by-product, and N~2~O itself ia a potent GHG with a global warming potential of about 265-298 over a 100-year time horizon.
-   If nitrogen releases from ammonia are not tightly controlled, the scale of the demands of maritime shipping fuel are such that the technology could significantly alter the global nitrogen cycle.

### Strengths

-   Stress the potential adverse side-effects of using ammonia that is not considered enough.

-   Calculated the amount of N~r~ caused by NH~3~ shipping fuels and that would negate climate benefits of NH~3~.

-   Found a key question of what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.

   
### Weakness

-   Only focuses on maritime emissions. But there are [other N~2~O emission sectors](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide).

-   Does not calculate what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.

-   No punchline figure.

### How to improve upon it for my own research

-   Track other fuels that cause N~2~O emission in other emission sectors, such as agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, etc.

## Direct air capture with carbon storage(DACCS)

* The role of direct air capture and negative emissions technologies in the shared socioeconomic pathways towards +1.5 ◦C and +2 ◦C futures[@fuhrman2021]

:::{.callout-note}
## Shared Socioeconomic Pathway

The shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework defines five storylines that differ in the challenges for mitigation and adaptation, resulting in different levels of long-term warming in the absence of global climate policies
:::

### Summarize the key findings

- IAM scenarios to date have relied almost on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation for negative emissions. But, land-intensive strategies could have large impacts on global agricultural and natural biological system.

- This study use GCAM to understand the role of direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) across all 5 SSPs for the below 2 ◦C and below 1.5 ◦C end-of-century warming goals.   

:::{.callout-important}
## Two constraints

Imposed on end-of-century **radiative forcing** increases from the pre-industrial levels: +2.6 W m^−2^, consistent with limiting warming in 2100 to below +2^◦^C, and +1.9 W m^−2^(below 1.5^◦^C in 2100).

**The discount rate**.
:::
- DACCS could play up to a tens of GtCO2 yr−1 role in many of these scenarios, particularly those with delayed climate policy and/or higher challenges to emissions mitigation.  


### Strengths

- Two different(high and low) DACCS technology details are considered. 
  + Assesed a DACCS process requiring high temperature heat from natural gas combustion, electricity, and water could contribute to both ambitious near-term and delayed mitigation scenarios that limit end-of century warming to below +1.5 ◦C.
  + The low-temperature DACCS process is assumed to use solid sorbents and not require water input

- Exogenous treatment of GCAM allows sensitivity analysis of cost or efficiency targets for different technologries.

[Other IAMs (e.g. WITCH, MERGE-ETL) endogenize these changes in cost and performance in an attempt to capture technological development in response to economic incentives]{.aside}
