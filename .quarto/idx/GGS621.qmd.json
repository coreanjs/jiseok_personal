Typically, these are run in a spreadsheet using highly simplified equations. They do not model the detailed processes and relationships of the economy, energy and Earth systems.These simple IAMs -- such as \"DICE\", \"FUND\" and \"PAGE\" -- are often used to calculate the \"social cost of carbon\", a measure of the quantifiable costs and benefits of emitting one additional tonne of CO2 in monetary terms.\n\n-   Second, there is a group of more **complex IAMs**, which are **the focus of this article**. These look at the energy technologies, energy use choices, land-use changes and societal trends that cause -- or prevent -- greenhouse gas emissions. They do this using linked **modules** representing the global economy, as well as its energy, land and climate systems.\n\n-   IAMs are used to answer \"what if\" questions about the relationships between society and the natural world, including its changing climate.\n\n-   [Edmonds, J. and J.

But **potential adverse side-effects** is not deeply discussed. Also,excessive [reactive notrigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen)(N~r~, 반응성 질소) in water and air leads to environmental damages such as eutrophication(부영양화) and air pollution.\n-   N~r~ usually emis N~2~O as a by-product, and N~2~O itself ia a potent GHG with a global warming potential of about 265-298 over a 100-year time horizon.\n-   If nitrogen releases from ammonia are not tightly controlled, the scale of the demands of maritime shipping fuel are such that the technology could **significantly alter the global nitrogen cycle.**\n\n### Strengths\n\n-   Stress the potential **adverse side-effects of using ammonia** that is **not considered enough**.\n\n-   Calculated the amount of N~r~ caused by NH~3~ shipping fuels and that would negate climate benefits of NH~3~.\n\n-   Found a key question of **what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O** on a multi-year timescale.\n\n### Weakness\n\n-   Only focuses on **maritime emissions**. But there are [other N~2~O emission sectors](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide).\n\n-   Does not calculate what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.\n\n-   No punchline figure.\n\n### How to improve upon it for my own research\n\n-   Track other fuels that cause N~2~O emission in other emission sectors, such as agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, etc.\n-   \n-   \n\n## Direct air capture with carbon storage(DACCS)\n\n![](GGS621/daccs.png)\n\n-   **The role of direct air capture and negative emissions technologies** in the shared socioeconomic pathways towards +1.5 ◦C and +2 ◦C futures[@fuhrman2021]\n\n::: callout-note\n## Shared Socioeconomic Pathway\n\nThe shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework defines **five storylines** that differ in the challenges for mitigation and adaptation, resulting in different levels of long-term warming in the absence of global climate policies\n:::\n\n### Summarize the key findings\n\n-   IAM scenarios to date have relied almost on **bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)** and afforestation/reforestation for negative emissions. But, land-intensive strategies could have large impacts on global agricultural and natural biological system.\n\n-   This study use GCAM to understand the role of **direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS)** across all 5 SSPs for the below 2 ◦C and below 1.5 ◦C end-of-century warming goals.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Two constraints\n\nImposed on end-of-century **radiative forcing** increases from the pre-industrial levels: +2.6 W m^−2^, consistent with limiting warming in 2100 to below +2^◦^C, and +1.9 W m^−2^(below 1.5^◦^C in 2100).\n\n**The discount rate**.\n:::\n\n-   DACCS could play up to a tens of GtCO2 yr−1 role in many of these scenarios, particularly those with delayed climate policy and/or higher challenges to emissions mitigation.\n\n### Strengths\n\n-   **Two different(high and low) DACCS technology details** are considered.\n    -   Assesed a DACCS process requiring high temperature heat from natural gas combustion, electricity, and water could contribute to both ambitious near-term and delayed mitigation scenarios that limit end-of century warming to below +1.5 ◦C.\n    -   The low-temperature DACCS process is assumed to use solid sorbents and not require water input\n-   **Exogenous treatment of GCAM** allows sensitivity analysis of cost or efficiency targets for different technologries.\n\n[Other IAMs (e.g. WITCH, MERGE-ETL) endogenize these changes in cost and performance in an attempt to capture technological development in response to economic incentives]{.aside}\n\n### Weakness\n\n-   These scenarios relied almost solely on **BECCS** and **afforestation** for negative emissions because structures for modeling alternative pathways were not included, constituting a limitation in these scenario designs.\n\n-   \n\n-   \n\n### How to improve upon it for my own research\n\n-   \n\n-   \n\n-   \n\n# **Week 2.**\n\n::: callout-note\n## Lecture note - 2023-09-06\n\n-   **Send a title for paper critique**.\n-   Dollar in 1978 are more valuable than today.\n:::\n\n-   한 분야가 아닌 전체 시스템의\n\nFoundations of Integrated Assessment: history, evolution of the tool and overall structure, types of applications and examples.\n\n-   [John Weyant.

However, there are two basic types: **detailed process (DP) IAMs** and **benefit--cost (BC) IAMs**.\n    -   Challenges include\n        -   what to count and how to count it\n        -   the inclusion of extreme and discontinuous outcomes\n        -   the treatment of regional, national, and international equity\n        -   the treatment of intertemporal discounting and intergenerational equity\n        -   projections of baseline drivers\n        -   capturing interactions between impact sectors and feedbacks to the climate system\n        -   dealing with uncertainty and risk\n    -   Insights and contributions\n        -   First, aggregate BC IAMs have improved our understanding of **the importance of costeffectiveness in designing climate policies**.\n        -   Second, **projections from DP IAMs provide much more detail than BC IAMs** by identifying key energy technologies and impact sectors/regions, including energy, water, land, agriculture, forestry, and ecosystem impacts in exceptionally hot and cold or wet and dry regions.\n    -   Reccomendations\n        -   To consider an even more comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses that has typically been included thus far - one that includes alternative treatments of concepts such as equity, attitudes toward risk, and the amount of technological optimism.\n        -   Second, given all the uncertainties concerning the inputs to, structures of, and parameter values included in IAMs, it is important to continue to develop decision support tools based on---and supplementary to---conventional IAMs.\n        -   Finally, although most of the major uncertainties confronting the models will not be resolved for decades, society cannot afford to wait to make climate policy decisions until these uncertainties are resolved and the BC or DP IAM calculations are further refined.\n    -   [Fisher-Vanden, K. and Weyant, J., 2020.
