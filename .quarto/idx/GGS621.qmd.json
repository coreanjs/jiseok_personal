But potential adverse side-effects is not deeply discussed. Also,excessive [reactive notrigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen)(N~r~, 반응성 질소) in water and air leads to environmental damages such as eutrophication(부영양화) and air pollution.\n-   N~r~ usually emis N~2~O as a by-product, and N~2~O itself ia a potent GHG with a global warming potential of about 265-298 over a 100-year time horizon.\n-   If nitrogen releases from ammonia are not tightly controlled, the scale of the demands of maritime shipping fuel are such that the technology could significantly alter the global nitrogen cycle.\n\n### Strengths\n\n-   Stress the potential adverse side-effects of using ammonia that is not considered enough.\n\n-   Calculated the amount of N~r~ caused by NH~3~ shipping fuels and that would negate climate benefits of NH~3~.\n\n-   Found a key question of what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.\n\n-   \n\n    ### Weakness\n\n-   Only focuses on maritime emissions. But there are [other N~2~O emission sectors](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide).\n\n-   Does not calculate what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.\n\n-   No punchline figure.\n\n### How to improve upon it for my own research\n\n-   Track other fuels that cause N~2~O emission in other emission sectors, such as agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, etc.\n-   \n-   \n\n# Reference\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"github","self-contained":false,"output-file":"GGS621.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"GGS621","date":"last-modified","author":[{"name":"Jiseok AHN","affiliation":"KAIST"}],"title-block-banner":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"toc-title":"목차"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
