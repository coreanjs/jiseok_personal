Go to [GCAM-KAIST](https://github.com/GCAM-KAIST/gcam-core).\n\n2.  Pick a branch to start from (currently: hcm/proj/kaist7update).\n\n3.  Create your own branch \\[you own this. No one else will make changes to your own branch\\].\n\n4.  [git clone](https://github.com/GCAM-KAIST/gcam-core.git) \\[this creates a full repo of GCAM-KAIST\\].\n\n5.  git checkout \\[your branch name\\] \\[this sets your branch on your own computer\\].\n\n6.  Try making a small inconsequential change. Such as adding a small xml file in the input/policy folder.\n\n7.  git add \\[file you added\\].\n\n8.  git commit \\[this will commit all files you added/changed\\].\n\n9.  git push.\n\n10. Confirm that your commit has been correctly pushed to github.\n\n11. (if you are happy with your development, and would like it to be applied to ALL GCAM-KAIST users) create a pull request (PR) \\[back into the main GCAM-KAIST repo\\].\n\n12. Assign me (d3y419) as the reviewer.

Each one of the team is responsible for a particular XML file which is identified in the following [link](gcam-kaist-upgrade7b.xlsx).\n\n1.  Download the Required Versions\n\nGCAM 7.0 Official Release by JCRI: You can download this latest version from the following [link](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/releases/download/gcam-v7.0/gcam-v7.0-Windows-Release-Package.zip).\n\nGCAM-KAIST 2.0: This is our specialized version at KAIST. Please download it using the [link](https://o365kaist-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ahmeds_office_kaist_ac_kr/EuCnuJZbojFLjz5o0q3dwaYBQ4QihxB_7z8umGiHIeos8A?e=jnZFqE) .\n\n2.  Analyze the Differences\n\nXML File Comparison: Please compare the XML files between the two versions as per your specific task in the google sheet. Document the Differences: Note any discrepancies, changes, or new features. This will help us understand what needs to be transferred or adapted.\n\n3.  Update GCAM 7.0 with GCAM-KAIST 2.0 Data\n\nModify the Original GCAM 7.0 XML Files: Replace the necessary data with the corresponding data from GCAM-KAIST 2.0. Follow the Evolution Process: This is vital to complete the transformation from GCAM-KAIST 2.0 to GCAM-KAIST 7.0 by checking the \"comparison with GCAM-KAIST2\" column in google sheet. After running the scenario, you can check if the results are different from GCAM-KAIST2.0 or not.\n\n4.  Prepare for Tomorrow's Meeting\n\nClarification of Differences: Be prepared to discuss the differences you've identified and how you've addressed them.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"github","self-contained":false,"output-file":"documentation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Documentation","date":"last-modified","author":[{"name":"IAM team","affiliation":"KAIST"}],"title-block-banner":true,"toc-title":"목차"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
