## Background {.smaller}

S.Korea reverses the nuclear phase-out policy of the previous administration.

-   Electricity demand will increase with the rapid electrification and with the increase in investments in cutting-edge industries.

-   Supply capacity needs to be expanded for stable electricity supply. Increasing the possibility of building new nuclear power plants.

-   It is estimated that nuclear power will make up a greater part of overall power generation for 2038 once the final version of the next basic plan contains plans to build new nuclear power plants.

-   However, experts are pointing out that sufficient review and discussion should precede construction projects for large-scale nuclear power plants.

## Motivation {.smaller}

Electricity infrastructure is prone to cost overrun issues almost independently of technology or location.

::: fragment
-   hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors have the greatest amount and frequency of cost overruns. [@sovacool2014].

-   Projections of nuclear plant costs have repeatedly failed to predict the cost overruns observed[@sovacool2014a].

-   [@eash-gates2020] suggests a bottom-up cost modeling mechanisms to identify the rise in nuclear construction costs over the past five decades.

## Research questions

::: callout-note
## Research Questions are as follows

1.  How does cpaturing the cost of nuclear capacity expansion affects of its share of South Korea's electricity generation over time?
2.  How does the endogeneous modelling of nuclear power plants affect the electrification of end-use sectors?
3.  How does the inclusion of historically observed cost overruns for South Korea's nuclear power plants affect electricity generation and end-use sectors?

## Research Objectives

-   Fiscal Impacts of industry collapse
-   Local fossil fuel econommy
-   Public finance redistribution - Fiscal federalism

## Previous Studies {.smaller}

Cost overrun expectations are usually not considered in IAMs, but few have been implemented in some regional analysis.

-   A case study of Ecuador uses a partial equilibrium energy system optimization model(TIMES) to address uncertainties around investment cost overruns[@carvajal2019].

-   Using the MESSAGE model(COPPE-MSB), [@k√∂berle2018] analyzes the effects of cost overruns and construction delays through 2050 on the results of a cost-optimal energy infrastructure expansion model for Brazil.

-   [@arbuckle2021] provides the reason to be more cautious about cost overruns in electricity generation planning. -canada
