## Paper critique

-   Using ammonia as a shipping fuel could disturb the nitrogen cycle[@wolfram2022]

![](GGS621/ammonia.png)

### Summarize the key findings

-   Ammonia(NH~3~) has been proposed as a shipping fuel. But potential adverse side-effects is not deeply discussed. Also,excessive [reactive notrigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen)(N~r~, 반응성 질소) in water and air leads to environmental damages such as eutrophication(부영양화) and air pollution.
-   N~r~ usually emis N~2~O as a by-product, and N~2~O itself ia a potent GHG with a global warming potential of about 265-298 over a 100-year time horizon.
-   If nitrogen releases from ammonia are not tightly controlled, the scale of the demands of maritime shipping fuel are such that the technology could significantly alter the global nitrogen cycle.

### Strengths

-   Stress the potential adverse side-effects of using ammonia that is not considered enough.

-   Calculated the amount of N~r~ caused by NH~3~ shipping fuels and that would negate climate benefits of NH~3~.

-   Found a key question of what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.

-   

    ### Weakness

-   Only focuses on maritime emissions. But there are [other N~2~O emission sectors](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide).

-   Does not calculate what portion of the NH~3~ and NO~x~ emissions will indirectly resolve to N~2~O on a multi-year timescale.

-   No punchline figure.

### How to improve upon it for my own research

-   Track other fuels that cause N~2~O emission in other emission sectors, such as agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, etc.
